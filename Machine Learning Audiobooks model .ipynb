    "You are given data from an Audiobook app. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that is why he/she is in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend money on advertising to him/her. If we can focus or efforts ONLY on customers that are lkely to convert again, we can make great savings. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a csv summarising the data. There are several variables. Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg (average of all purchases),Book length in minutes_sum (sum of all purchases), Price Paid avg (average of all purchases), Price paid_sum (sum of all purchases, Review (a Boolean variable), Review (out of 10), Total minutues listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are the inputs (excluding customer ID, as it is completely arbitrary. It's more like a name, than a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "The targets are a Boolean variable (so 0 or 1). We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. So, in fact, we are predicting if, based on the last 2 years of activity and engagement, a customer will convert in the next 6 months. 6 months sounds like a reasonable time. If they don't convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or don't like the Audiobook way of digesting information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is simple: create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classificatiin with two classes: won't buy or will buy, represented by 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
